Introspector is a **modular offensive framework** that combines:

- <span class="chip">HTTP</span> passive listeners (multi-port)
- <span class="chip">DNS</span> callback capture (UDP)
- <span class="chip">Payload Hosting</span> dynamic endpoints + hosted files
- <span class="chip">Redirect Intel</span> tracking + follow detection
- <span class="chip">Execution Trace</span> correlation-friendly logs and UI

It’s designed for *black-box* workflows where you want to emit inputs, receive callbacks, and understand what actually happened — without building one-off tooling for every target.
